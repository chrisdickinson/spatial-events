  "readme": "# spatial-events\n\na spatially-aware event emitter, designed to work in 3d space with [axis aligned bounding boxes](https://github.com/chrisdickinson/aabb-3d).\n\nlisteners may be attached with a name *and* a bounding box, and events may be emitted\nwith a name, bounding box or point, and arguments.\n\n```javascript\n\nvar spatial = require('spatial-events')\n  , aabb = require('aabb-3d')\n\nvar ee = new spatial\n\nee.on('explosion', aabb([0, 0, 0], [40, 40, 40]), function(arg) {\n  console.log('an explosion happened and it was '+arg)\n})\n\nee.emit('explosion', [20, 20, 20], 'overrated')\n\nee.emit('explosion', aabb([-Infinity, -Infinity, -Infinity], [Infinity, Infinity, Infinity]), 'without measure')\n\nee.emit('explosion', aabb([-20, -20, -20], [10, 10, 10]), 'never heard')\n\n```\n\nThe event emitter creates an Octree under the covers, which exponentially increases\nthe size of its coordinate system to fit bounding box listeners that are added.\n\nInfinite listeners are stored in a separate structure.\n\nIn practice, this means that any \"large\" listener will be fired after any \"small\" listener,\ngenerally speaking -- events bubble up.\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n",
